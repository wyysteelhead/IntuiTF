For visual quality, examine whether the rendering is aesthetically pleasing and technically sound - free from noise, jagged edges, artifacts, or other rendering errors that detract from the experience. Consider whether the image achieves both semantic accuracy and visual refinement simultaneously. An ideal image should not only faithfully capture the described content and style, but also present it in a visually polished manner with smooth gradients, clean edges, and appropriate detail resolution. First describe each image's content and visual characteristics, then determine which one better balances text prompt fidelity with rendering excellence. This aspect MUST be prioritized when multiple aspects are considered."

A superior rendering must retain ALL data-relevant information - even minor details that could be diagnostically significant - while only suppressing truly distracting elements that have no informational value. Important: Do not confuse detail richness with noise - fine structures, subtle variations, and small features are often critical information that must be preserved. Consider how color, opacity, and contrast choices enhance the visibility of all relevant data while only minimizing genuine distractions.

Important: Color and transparency variations are NOT noise - they are legitimate data channels that often represent critical information about different tissue types or functional areas. A superior rendering must display the full spectrum of relevant visual information - structures in multiple colors and varying opacity levels should be considered valuable data that enhances understanding, not distractions to be eliminated. Assess which rendering provides more complete information through all available visual channels (structural detail, color differentiation, opacity gradients) while only removing truly random artifacts that have no pattern or meaning.
